🚆 Railway Reservation System (Java Console Application)
🧩 Overview

The Railway Reservation System is a Java-based console application developed to simulate ticket booking for the Chennai Express.
It allows users to book tickets, cancel reservations, search passengers, and view the reservation chart — all from a simple text-based interface.
The system is implemented using Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles, with classes such as Passenger, TicketService, ConsoleUI, and ReservationApplication.

⚙️ Features:-

🎫 Book Ticket – Book seats in AC, First, or Sleeper class.
❌ Cancel Ticket – Cancel tickets and receive refunds.
🔍 Search Passenger – Find details using passenger number.
📋 Reservation Chart – Display passengers by travel class.
🪑 Unbooked Tickets – Check available seats in each class.
💡 Interactive Menu – Simple console-based UI for smooth navigation.
💻 Technologies Used
